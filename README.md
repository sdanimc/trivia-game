Users click the "let's play" buttons to start the game, initating the timer and show the first question and the answer buttons. Answering each question triggers the next question to appear.
Incorrect answers cause the loss of 10 seconds from the game clock while correct answers add 1 point to the players score. 
When time runs out or all questions are answered, a game over pop up tells them how many they got wrong and right. 
If the player's score is equal to or greater than the lowest saved highscore, they will be prompted to save their score
If the player hits cancel, their score won't be saved. If they chose to enter their name, their score and name will be added to the scoreboard. Clicking Clear Highscores will erase all scores on the board.
Users can click "let's play" to restart the game from the beginning and reset their current score
